## üõ†Ô∏è Core Technologies Used Across All Projects

While each project is unique, they are all built on a foundation of modern, industry-standard front-end technologies:

-   **HTML5:** Clean, semantic, and accessible markup.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid, responsive, utility-first styling and layouts.
-   **Custom CSS3:** For advanced visuals, including `@keyframes` animations, glassmorphism, neon glows, and complex hover effects.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+):** The engine for all interactivity, from simple DOM manipulation to complex, object-oriented state management.
-   **Modern Browser APIs:** Leveraging powerful tools like the **Intersection Observer** for performance and the **Web Speech API** for advanced features.

## 1. Personal Portfolio Website


A modern, responsive, and fully interactive personal portfolio designed to serve as my digital resume and showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience.

**Live Demo:** [https://youtu.be/_HEgsw7qsYk]

### ‚ú® Key Features & Skills Demonstrated:

-   **Professional Showcase:** Clearly structured to highlight my education, skills, and key projects (like my **DesignX Club** work and **Kshitiksha Foundation** internship).
-   **Interactive UI/UX:** Features smooth scrolling, a 3D project card flip effect, and a dynamic typing animation to create an engaging user experience.
-   **Performant Animations:** Utilizes the **Intersection Observer API** for efficient, scroll-based fade-in animations that don't bog down the browser.
-   **Responsive Design:** Built with a mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS to ensure a seamless experience on all devices.

### üéØ Purpose:

This project demonstrates my ability to build a polished, professional, and performant marketing website from scratch, meeting all the requirements for a modern portfolio.

## 2. TaskFlow Pro - Advanced To-Do App

A feature-rich, single-page task management application with a futuristic, glassmorphism UI. This project showcases my ability to build a complex application with vanilla JavaScript, focusing on state management and dynamic UI rendering.

**Live Demo:** [https://youtu.be/G-p4lEiK29s]

### ‚ú® Key Features & Skills Demonstrated:

-   **Object-Oriented JavaScript:** The entire application logic is encapsulated within a single, scalable `AdvancedTaskManager` class, demonstrating a professional and organized coding style.
-   **Full CRUD Functionality:** Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks, with all changes instantly reflected in the UI.
-   **Persistent State:** Uses the browser's **LocalStorage** to save all tasks, so user data persists between sessions.
-   **Advanced Filtering & Sorting:** A comprehensive system allows users to filter tasks by status and search query, and sort by multiple criteria.
-   **Dynamic Dashboard:** An interactive dashboard visualizes productivity stats with animated progress rings and a daily completion streak.
-   **Web Speech API:** Integrates voice-to-text functionality for hands-free task searching.

### üéØ Purpose:

This project demonstrates my proficiency in building complex, stateful single-page applications (SPAs) using core JavaScript, proving my understanding of the principles that power modern frameworks like React and Vue.

## 3. NeoTech - Cyberpunk E-commerce UI

A visually stunning and highly interactive e-commerce front-end interface with a unique cyberpunk theme. This project is a deep dive into creating a complex, filterable product showcase and managing its state purely on the client side.

**Live Demo:** [https://youtu.be/s3-WuAavRio]

### ‚ú® Key Features & Skills Demonstrated:

-   **Complex State Management:** A single "source of truth" JavaScript object (`activeFilters`) manages all user selections, from checkboxes and sliders to sort-order dropdowns.
-   **Instant, Client-Side Filtering:** All filtering and sorting operations happen instantly in the browser without any page reloads, creating a lightning-fast user experience.
-   **Advanced CSS for Theming:** Showcases a deep understanding of CSS with features like:
    -   **Glassmorphism** (`backdrop-filter`)
    -   **Neon Glows** (`box-shadow`, `text-shadow`)
    -   **Animated Gradients** and custom `@keyframes` animations.
-   **Dynamic Rendering:** The product grid is dynamically generated and re-rendered from a JavaScript array, a core concept in modern web development.
-   **Performance Optimization:** The search input uses a `debounce` function to prevent excessive re-rendering while the user is typing, ensuring the UI remains smooth.

### üéØ Purpose:

This project serves as a testament to my ability to build a complex, high-performance, and visually appealing user interface that requires sophisticated state management‚Äîall accomplished with vanilla JavaScript.
